Alarm Clock Project


Requirements:
- Display the current time in a digital clock format (Hours:Minutes:Seconds)
- Make sure the clock updates every second without refreshing the page
- Pick a time to make the alarm go off -  for example:  a button that sets the alarm to go off 10 seconds from now
- Start the alarm when the difference between the current time and the time the alarm is set for reaches 0 (Tip: use a javascript alert, you do not need it to make noise)

Stretch Goals:
- Change the font for the display; a mono-spaced font would look more like a digital clock
- Add the date (day, month, and year)
- Add a button for toggling between a 12-hour and a 24-hour display
- Allow the user to pick a time for the alarm to go off using an HTML datetime Input element
- Play an audible alert when the alarm goes off (instead of a JS alert)
- Allow the user to set multiple alarms
- Have a button to snooze the alarm for 5 minutes
- Have a toggle to turn on or off the alarm (I only wake up at 6 on the weekdays, but turn off my alarm on the weekend)
- Make it look like an analog clock
