Alarm Clock Project


Requirements
- Display the current time in a digital clock format (Hours:Minutes:Seconds)
- Make sure the clock updates every second without refreshing the page
- Pick a time to make the alarm go off -  for example:  a button that sets the alarm to go off 10 seconds from now
- Start the alarm when the difference between the current time and the time the alarm is set for reaches 0 (Tip: use a javascript alert, you do not need it to make noise)
